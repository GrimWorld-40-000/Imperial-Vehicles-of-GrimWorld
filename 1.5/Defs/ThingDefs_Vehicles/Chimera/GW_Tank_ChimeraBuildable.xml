		<description>The Astra Militarum Chimera is a stalwart armored vehicle within the Warhammer 40,000 universe, serving as a linchpin in the Imperial Guard's mechanized forces. Its sturdy, boxy chassis, mounted on tracks, ensures durability on various terrains. Armed with a multi-laser or customizable weaponry, the Chimera provides essential fire support.\n\nThis versatile vehicle shines in its dual role. As a troop transport, the open-topped rear compartment swiftly shuttles Imperial Guard infantry squads, facilitating strategic deployments. Simultaneously, its formidable armament allows it to engage enemy targets effectively, contributing to the combined arms tactics of the Imperial Guard.\n\nIn the chaotic and grim warfare of the 41st millennium, the Chimera is emblematic of the Imperium's commitment to defending against existential threats. Adorned with Imperial symbols, it stands as a symbol of loyalty and resilience, embodying the grim aesthetic of the Warhammer 40,000 universe.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Gunner x1, Passenger x12\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</description>
