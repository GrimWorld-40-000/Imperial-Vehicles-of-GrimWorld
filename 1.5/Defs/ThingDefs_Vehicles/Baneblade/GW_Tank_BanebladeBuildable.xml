		<description>The heaviest vehicle regularly fielded by the Imperial Guard, the Baneblade super-heavy tank can truly rain down the Emperorâ€™s wrath on the enemy. Its primary armament is a 250mm Baneblade Cannon with a coaxial autocannon, with a twin-linked heavy bolter on a turret below it. \n\nOn each side is a lascannon turret and another twin-linked heavy bolter turret, and mounted on the front is a colossal 380mm Demolisher Cannon - enough firepower to not only annihilate any other tank on the battlefield, but also to destroy its infantry and APC support along with it. \n\nIt is said that one Baneblade commander demanded to be driven closer to the enemy, so that he may attack with his sword as well. It is not known whether he succeeded or not. \n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Gunner x5\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</description>
