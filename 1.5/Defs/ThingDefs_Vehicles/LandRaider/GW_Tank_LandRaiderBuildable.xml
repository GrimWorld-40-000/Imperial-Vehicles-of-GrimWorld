		<label>Land Raider</label>
		<description>A heavy tank of the Adeptus Astartes, the Land Raider provides some of the heaviest fire support the Space Marines can bring to bear. Armed with a front-mounted, twin-linked heavy bolter and a twin-linked lascannon turret on each side, it can reliably defeat enemy infantry and APCs, shrug off enemy small-arms fire with its thick armor, and exploit breakthroughs with its complement of eight infantry. \n\nThe Land Raider is named so not because it raids on the land, but because it was discovered by techno-archaeologist Arkhan Land, a Magos of the ancient Mechanicum. He had discovered the STC fragments for its design, along with that of the fast-attack Land Speeder and the agricultural Land Crawler, in the Librarius Omnis, a continent-sized underground library on Mars. \n\nHe did not survive the second expedition. \n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Gunner x2, Passenger x8\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Uranium</description>
